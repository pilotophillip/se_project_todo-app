# Simple ToDo App

A clean and straightforward ToDo application built with JavaScript, demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and form validation.

---

## Functionality

This app allows users to manage their to-do list efficiently. Users can:

- View a pre-populated list of tasks.
- Add new tasks with optional due dates via a popup form.
- Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.
- Delete tasks.
- Enjoy form validation that ensures task names are entered correctly before submission.

The project uses ES6 classes (`Todo` and `FormValidator`) to modularize the code, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

## Technology

- **JavaScript ES6+**: Leveraging modern JavaScript features and classes.
- **UUID library**: Generates unique IDs for to-do items via the `uuidv4` function imported from a CDN.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Semantic markup and responsive styling using BEM methodology.
- **JavaScript Modules**: Organized file structure with modules for components (`Todo.js`, `FormValidator.js`) and utilities (`constants.js`).
- **Form validation**: Implemented using a reusable `FormValidator` class to ensure robust input handling.
- **Live Server**: Used during development to support JS modules and live reload.
